# Tools for manipulating attestations (producing, transforming, consuming)

- [Proof-Carrying Data SDK](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass) by the [PCD Team](https://pcd.team/)
- Web proofs: by default, data received over TLS cannot be shared in a verifiable manner, but several projects aim to add a protocol on top of TLS to make the received data verifiable.
    - [TLS Notary](https://tlsnotary.org/)
    - [Pluto](https://pluto.xyz/)
    - [Reclaim Protocol](https://www.reclaimprotocol.org/)
- [zkEmail](https://prove.email/) is a highly flexible tool to transform signed emails into attestations to specific claims contained within those emails. 
- [Gribi](https://github.com/tonk-gg/gribi) The Gribi interface allows for independent cryptosystems to more easily link together functionality without directly coordinating.
