# Introduction

This wiki aims to present a live overview of the technology and application landscape outlined above. Throughout this document, we use the computational framework from [SoK: Programmable Privacy in Distributed Systems](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/982.pdf) which is represented in the mindmap.
