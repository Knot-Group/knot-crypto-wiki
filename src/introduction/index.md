# Introduction

Welcome to the wiki on 
- programmable cryptography 
- and advanced decentralisation technologies 
- for novel, emergent applications

# Why Wiki 

1. A single channel to surface the latest projects, tools, and resources related to the above intersections. 
2. Education on how these technologies may be used to build novel applications.
3. Coverage on emergent use cases for these technologies.

We use the computational framework from [SoK: Programmable Privacy in Distributed Systems](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/982.pdf) to organize the structure of applications and associated technologies. 

# Contribution
