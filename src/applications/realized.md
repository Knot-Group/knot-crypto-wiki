## Freedom Tool

Online voting systems are the most accessible way for people to participate in democracy, especially for those living under oppressive regimes. However, they typically lack transparency and are prone to Sybil and cyber attacks.

Rarimo has employed zero-knowledge cryptography to address these challenges and built Freedom Tool, a decentralized, transparent, and privacy-preserving online voting tool on blockchain.

## Creddd

Creddd is a piece of your onchain reputation. It's created automatically whenever you do things onchain.

It shows, cryptographically, that you've done things you say you've done. It's **privacy-preserving**; you don't have to reveal your address to use your creddd.

## ZKSummit 11 Cursive App

Every attendee will get an NFC card alongside their badge, and additional NFC cards will be placed in front of rooms where talks and workshops are held. Tapping another attendee's card allows you to see their contact information, as well as receive a digital signature that verifiably represents the fact that you met them. Tapping a card associated with a talk gives you a digital signature proving you attended that talk. There are 3 main things you can do with these signatures: make zero knowledge proofs, privately compute the things you've done in common with someone else, and aggregate the signatures into one big proof of your entire event experience - ZK Summit Folded!
