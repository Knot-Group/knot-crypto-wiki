# Investigations 

This is where we keep track of active investigations into *open questions*.

### Mobile Proving
### Composing Attestations
### Failure Modes


## Open Questions
- The proofs we generate are a snapshot in time, but often we are more interested in mutations and up-to-date data. How do we keep our data fresh and propagate updates?
- How can we improve the UX of Trust Infrastructure?
    - ZKEmail copy and paste raw data
    - TLSNotary clunky chrome extensions
    - etc
- What other different security design / assumptions are available?
    - Off-loading most work to 3rd party services?
